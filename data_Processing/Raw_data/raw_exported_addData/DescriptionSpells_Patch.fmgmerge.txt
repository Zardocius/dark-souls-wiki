Fire homing crystal soulmass.

The mysteries of souls, crystals, and the
sorceries are deeply intertwined.

###3070
Sorcery boosted by the knowledge
Logan acquired at the Regal Archives.
Fire piercing crystal soul spear.

These pale magic spears, sharpened
through crystallization, are on par with
the armaments of the ancient lords.

###3120
Sorcery boosted by the knowledge
Logan acquired at the Regal Archives.
High magic + crystallization: right weapon.

Logan's trials were successful, and the
crystal medium facilitated a stronger bond
between weapon and soul.

###3600
Sorcery of the red-robed remedician
Ingward, guardian of the seal in New Londo.
Sacrifice humanity to undo curse.

Abhorrent curses eat away at the core of
one's very existence, and cleansing oneself
of curses is no easy task indeed.

###3710
Abyss sorcery discovered by an Oolacile
sorcerer on the brink of madness.
Fire giant Dark Orb.
In contrast to standard soul sorceries,
Abyss sorceries are weighty and inflict
physical damage. Perhaps human souls,
because of their humanity, produce
sorceries with more tangible presence.

###3720
Abyss sorcery discovered by an Oolacile
sorcerer on the brink of madness.
Fire successive Dark Orbs.

In contrast to standard soul sorceries,
Abyss sorceries are weighty and inflict
physical damage. Perhaps a human soul is
closer to matter in its humanity.

###3730
Abyss sorcery discovered by an Oolacile
sorcerer on the brink of madness.
Create a cloud of Dark Fog.

Although Dark Fog is, in theory, relatively
close to humanity, it also happens to be a
terrible poison for humans. Perhaps it
reflects man's cruelty against his own.

###3740
Sorcery of Manus, Father of the Abyss.
Grant a fleeting will to the Dark of
humanity, and volley the result.

The will feels envy, or perhaps love,
and despite the inevitably trite and
tragic ending, the will sees no alternative,
and is driven madly toward its target.

###4200
Unique pyromancy crafted by Eingyi,
considered a heretic even at the Great Swamp.
Create poison mist.

Eingyi became an egg-bearing Undead who
serves a deformed young girl who speaks
an unintelligible tongue.

###4210
Unique pyromancy crafted by Eingyi,
considered a heretic even at the Great Swamp.
Create intense poison mist.

Why was Eingyi driven from the Great Swamp?
One only need cast this pyromancy, a perverse
diversion from the art of fire, to find out.

###4500
Art of the Flame of Chaos, which engulfed
the Witch of Izalith and her daughters.
Hurl a giant chaos fireball.

The Flame of Chaos can melt stone,
producing a short-lived lava glob.

###4510
Art of the Flame of Chaos, which engulfed
the Witch of Izalith and her daughters.
Erect localized chaos fire pillars.

The Witch of Izalith, in an ambitious attempt
to copy the First Flame, created instead the
Flame of Chaos, a twisted bed of life.

###4520
Art of the Flame of Chaos, which engulfed
the Witch of Izalith and her daughters.
Sweep foes with chaos fire whip.

The fire whip was wielded by the
eldest of the Daughters of Chaos.

###4530
A pyromancy discovered from
the Dark of the Abyss by a pyromancer
who wandered into Oolacile.
Conjure a great black flame in one's palm.

Black flames are weighty, and inflict
physical damage, enough to smack away
the mightiest of shields.
