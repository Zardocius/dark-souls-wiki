The three young clericsâ€¦
headed for the Catacombs, to seek Kindling.

###56000000
...Mmn...ahh...

###56000010
...Aah...mmn...

###56000020
...Hmm...mm...

###56000100
...This may strike thine ear as somewhat peculiar, but...

###56000110
Long ago, in my homeland of Oolacile,
I was beset by a creature from the Abyss.

###56000120
I would have perished then,
were it not for the great knight Artorias.

###56000130
In truth, I saw little of what transpired,
for mine senses were already fled!

###56000140
But even still, there was something about Artorias...
A certain balance of the humours...

###56000150
...That quite perfectly fits your semblance.

###56000160
Heavens, could it be that...

###56000170###60000310
...

###56000180
Oh, dear me. That was Oolacile,
many centuries ago.

###56000190
Please excuse my fanciful musings. 

###56000200
Excuse me for such whimsical utterances.

###56000210
Only, it was so very odd...

###56000220
You, and Artorias. I owe my life to each of you.
And both seem to share some resonance of sorts...

###56000230
Perhaps it is the nature of true greatness.

###56000300
I still think on that creature from the Abyss that preyed upon me.

###56000310
My faculties were far from lucid, but I quite clearly sensed certain emotions.

###56000320
A wrenching nostalgia, a lost joy, an object of obsession,
and a sincere hope to reclaim it...

###56000330
Could these thoughts belong to the beast from the Abyss?

###56000340
But if that were true, then perhaps it is no beast after all?

###56000350
Oh, please forgive my ramblings.

###56000360
It's just that, I wish to know the truth.

###56000370
And no one, not even loving Elizabeth, will tell me.

###56005000
Aah...

###56005010
Eek!

###57000000
...Whatever thou art, stay away...

###57000010
...Soon, I will be consumed...

###57000020
...By them, by the Dark...

###57000030
Oogh...

###57000040
Grrah!

###57000050
Hrgg, hrgggrah!

###57000100
...Thou art strong, human...

###57000110
...Surely thine kind are more than pure Dark...

###57000120
...I beg of thee...the spread of the Abyss...
...it must be stopped...

###57000130
Cough!

###57000140
...Ah, Sif, there you are, all of you...Forgive me...

###57000150
...For I have availed you nothing...

###57005000
Hrgg...

###57005010###57005020###57005200###57005210###57005220
Hrggraaah!

###57005100
Hrgkt!

###57005110
Ergkt!

###57005120
Hrgg!

###58000000###58002300
Hm? A visitor, have we?

###58000010###58002310
Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.

###58000020###58002320
An old friend he was, and thanks to thee...

###58000030###58002330
He left this world with honour intact.

###58000040
...And here I am, retired and blind.

###58000050
Of little help to thee, I am afraid.

###58000100
Well, thou hast come again. This is a surprise.

###58000200
Well, thou com'st again. Thou art a strange one.

###58000300
Good morrow...Is the Black Dragon posing thee duress?

###58000400
Yes, I thought as much.

###58000410
He is called Kalameet.

###58000420
A ferocious dragon indeed, even mighty Anor Londo dared not provoke his ire.

###58000430
I see little good coming from this, but...

###58000440
...Thy intent is to persevere... to the bitter end, hmm?

###58000500
Hah hah hah!

###58000510
Good, good. What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness!

###58000520
I have taken a liking to thee.

###58000530
And I owe thee much for thy service to Artorias.
Now watch, and see how Gough hunts dragons.

###58000540
Hrrmmm...

###58000550
Haah!

###58000560
Hah hah! Yes, a truer shot was never loosed!

###58000570
That bat will be grounded for a good spell!

###58000580
The rest is in thine hands. I await good tidings.

###58000590
Ahh, dragon slaying. Knighthood's highest calling...

###58000600
...Strange. I am rarely wrong on such matters...

###58000700
A wise choice. Why foist thyself unto the fiery maw?

###58000800
The Black Dragon troubles you yet, I see.

###58000900
...Hmm, yes, I see. I was mistaken...

###58001000
...Art thou prepared to challenge great Kalameet?

###58001100
Yes, surely that is best.

###58001200
Ah, hello there. What of Kalameet?

###58001210
He is an ancient dragon.
Skyward or no, he will not be put down easily.

###58001300
Why, thou hast defeated Kalameet!

###58001310###58002350###58002410
Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.

###58001320
That beast will never take to the skies again.

###58001400###58001500
Farewell, human.

###58001410
Lead thy life as thou seest fit.

###58001510
I await good tidings.

###58001600
Farewell, proud human.

###58001610
May every honour be bestowed upon thee.

###58001700
If thou seeketh to explore this domain, be wary of a black dragon.

###58001710
I fear thee no match for this terrible beast.

###58001800
I should confer...If thine was the blade to which Artorias fell.

###58001810
Then thou must be wary of Ciaran.

###58001820
She had strong feelings for the great Artorias.

###58001830
The poor, poor girl.

###58001900
Me?

###58001910
There is very little to be said.

###58001920
What good is a dog, with no hares to hunt?

###58001930
...I am lucky to be alive, I suppose.

###58002000
Now, do not mistake my words.

###58002010
I cherish my work. Wood carving is a nuanced art.

###58002020
I would have much to talk about with that blacksmith.

###58002030
In truth, how is the old chap, I wonder?

###58002040
Still hammering away, I should hope.

###58002100
The dragons shall never be forgotten...

###58002110
We knights fought valiantly, but for every one of them,
we lost three score of our own.

###58002120
Exhilaration, pride, hatred, rage...
The dragons teased out
our dearest emotions.

###58002130
...Thou will understand, one day.

###58002140
At thy twilight, old thoughts return, in great waves of nostalgia.

###58002200
Ahh, this Greatbow?

###58002210
I shan't need it, with no dragons to hunt.

###58002220
I know not if a human could even operate it, but here...

###58002230
Thy need outweighs mine.

###58002340
And I see that the great black dragon Kalameet is dusted by thine hand.

###58002360
I am retired, and blind.

###58002370
To receive a visit by one as lofty as thyself, is a great honour indeed.

###58002400
I see that thou hast dusted the great black dragon Kalameet.

###58002420
I see that there is at least one legend among ye humans.

###58002430
Dear me... That old bat will never fly again.

###58002500
Thou com'st again, legend of humans.

###58002510
It is always an honour to speak with thee.

###58002600
I suspect thou hast taken a gander at it,

###58002610
But the Dark of the Abyss, which swallowed poor Artorias,
threatens to devour our entire land of Oolacile.

###58002620
It seems that this dire fate is unavoidable.

###58002630
But, seduced by a Dark serpent or no,

###58002640
They awoke that thing themselves, and drove it mad.

###58002650
...One's demise is always one's own making.

###58002700
If thine wish is to succeed poor Artorias, and challenge the spread of the Dark,

###58002710
Then thou must face Manus, Father of the Abyss.

###58002720
The Dark emanates from Manus himself.

###58002730
Even if this land shall expire,
thou may be able to prevent further corrosion.

###58002740
...But even so, one day the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.

###58002750
And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that.

###58005000
Cease this.

###58005010
Stop it, I say.

###58005020
Understand this. I wish thee no harm.

###58005030###61005030
Stop that!

###58005040
By the Gods!

###58005100
Ahh, so this is true human nature.

###58005110
Artorias is in your debt, but thou leavest me little choice...

###58005120
May you perish, for the good of all!

###58005200###58005210
Mmgraah!

###58005220
Hahh...

###58005300
Oog!

###58005310###59005200
Ooph!

###58005320
Hrg!

###58005400
Arrgggg!

###58005410
Humans...hmph...

###58005420
What vile creatures...

###58006000
Hello

###58006001
Thank you

###58006002
Very good!

###58006003
I'm sorry!

###58006004
Help me!

###59000000
Hm...Oh, let me guess...

###59000010
Snatched by a shadowy limb,
and dragged off to the past?

###59000100
Yes, of course. Exactly what happened to me.

###59000110
We are both strangers in this strange land.

###59000120
But, at least now there are two of us.

###59000200
Oh, well, my mistake...

###59000210
But we are both travellers.

###59000220
We ought to help one another out.

###59000300
Oh, still alive, are you?

###59000310
Think of anything that you might need?

###59000400
Oh, for Juniper's sake.

###59000410
Put some spring into your step!

###59000420###59000520###59000840###59000940
Mwah hah hah!

###59000500
Oh, you again...

###59000510
What ever's the matter? No, I can tell. 
You need me more than ever.

###59000600###59000700
So long.

###59000710
...We'll be seeing each other...

###59000720
Gee hee hee!

###59000800
Did you happen across Knight Artorias?

###59000810
The legendary Abysswalker, from the old tales.

###59000820
...Well, if you haven't, it's just as well...

###59000830
He's a colourless sort, if you ask me.

###59000900
Did you really slay Knight Artorias?

###59000910
I'd heard the Abyss found him first,
but even still...

###59000920
That's absolutely treacherous.

###59000930
Yes, magnificently so!

###59001000
So, what did that giant mushroom make you do?

###59001010
Not that I care. It's none of my business.

###59001020
But I do wonder about those sorceries of hers...

###59001030###59001660
Heh heh heh...

###59001100
Hm? I've little to talk about, really.

###59001110
Oh, you know me. What do I know?

###59001120
Heh heh!

###59001200
What? If you've something to say, then say it!

###59001210
Just don't say the wrong thing...

###59001220
Heh heh heh!

###59001300
...Oh, you!

###59001310
You have quite some nerve. Or are you just thick?

###59001320
Fine, then. What is it that you need?

###59001400
I'll be seeing you.

###59001410
If you survive your travels...

###59001500
...Well, you've quite the nerve!

###59001510
I've had enough of you!

###59001600
Believe it or not,

###59001610
Oolacile has brought the Abyss upon itself.

###59001620
Fooled by that toothy serpent,
they upturned the grave of primeval man,
and incited his ornery wrath.

###59001630
What could they have been thinking?

###59001640
But to you and I, it's all ancient history.

###59001650
You have to ask yourself. Does it really matter?

###59005000
Oh! It's come to blows, has it?

###59005010
Fine, then. I've had enough of you, anyway!

###59005100
What now? You think this my fault?

###59005110
How very, very petty of you!

###59005120
Very petty, indeed!

###59005210###60005110
Erg!

###59005220
Oww!

###59005230
That bloody hurts!

###59005300
There!

###59005310
Ah-hah, there!

###59005400
What? Now you're feeling the heat?

###59005410
You should have thought long and hard...

###59005420
Before you sided with a bloody mushroom!

###59005430
Nyah hah hah hah hah!

###59005500
You damn fool.

###59005510
I am Marvellous Chester! What did you expect?

###59005600
Hrrg...

###59005610
You win...please...

###59005620
Oh, please...have mercy...

###60000000
...Human...

###60000010
...Why have you the ring of Artorias?

###60000011
...Why have you the soul of Artorias?

###60000020
...I am Ciaran, and that is a keepsake.

###60000100
...That ring...

###60000110
It was purloined by a man in a long coat...

###60000120
I know not how you came upon it,

###60000130
but its owner met his death here.

###60000140
He was a dear companion,
and I wish to return the ring to his grave.

###60000150###60000730
Would you be willing to part with it?

###60000200
Thank you. You are very kind.

###60000210
Please take this. I no longer need it.

###60000220
May the Lord guide thee.

###60000300
Yes, of course...

###60000320
...I must not be presumptuous.

###60000330
Artorias would not have approved.

###60000400
What is it? Something else?

###60000410
Have you changed your mind?

###60000500
...Then you have no business with me...

###60000600
...Are you human?

###60000610
...I forgive you.

###60000620
I am here to pay respects to a dear friend.

###60000630
Please, allow me a moment alone.

###60000700
...You, is that not...

###60000710
The soul of the man who fell on this spot?

###60000720
He was a dear friend. I wish to pay proper respect, with that soul.

###60005000
Hmph, you humans...

###60005010
...always taking what you please.
Then, I shall do the same.

###60005011
...always resorting to force.
Then, I shall do the same.

###60005100
Hrk!

###60005120###61005010
Ooh!

###60005200
Hmph, such conceit...

###60005210
How did you imagine that
the Lord's Blade would not reach you?

###60005300
But, how...

###60005310
You humans...

###61000000
Well, look at this one.

###61000010
From what far-away age hast thou come?
Thy scent is very human, indeed.

###61000020
...But, not intolerable...

###61000030
Ah, Princess Dusk's saviour.
Thine aura is precisely as she described.

###61000031
Princess Dusk has spoken of thee.
Thy aura is precisely as she described.

###61000040
I thank thee deeply,
for rescuing Her Highness.

###61000050
But Princess Dusk is here no longer...

###61000060
...snatched away by that horrifying primeval human.

###61000070
And so I must ask...
Couldst thou once more play the saviour?

###61000100
Thank you.

###61000110
I am Elizabeth, guardian of this sanctuary.

###61000120
Something of a godmother to Princess Dusk.

###61000130
I shall assist thee, to my utmost.

###61000140
For I am one with the sorceries of Oolacile.

###61000200
Yes, I understand.

###61000210
We care dearly for Princess Dusk,
and are apt to blur our boundaries.

###61000220
I am ashamed to have been so imposing.

###61000230
But should thine heart be changed,
speak to me again.

###61000240
This sanctuary, and the sorceries of Oolacile,
are my domain.

###61000250
My strength could surely assist thee in thy travels.

###61000300
Hast thou reconsidered?

###61000310
Such that thou might rescue dear Dusk?

###61000400
Yes, yes, of course.

###61000410
But shouldst thine heart be changed,
speak to me again.

###61000500
Thank goodness thou art safe.

###61000510
What is thy wish? I offer thee my all.

###61000600
Struggling, are we?

###61000610
If there is anything I can do,
never hesitate to ask.

###61000700
I have awaited thee.
Thou hast rescued Princess Dusk,

###61000710
...and rid us of that terrible primeval human.
Even halting the spread of the Abyss!

###61000720
I salute the grandeur of thine enterprise.

###61000730
Please, allow me to express my gratitude.

###61000740
I thank thee... as do we all.

###61000800
May the flames guide thee.

###61000900
Thou shalt see further on.

###61000910
An abyss was begat of the ancient beast, 
and threatens to swallow the whole of Oolacile.

###61000920
Knight Artorias came to stop this,
but such a hero has nary a murmur of Dark.

###61000930
Without doubt, he will be swallowed by the Abyss,
overcome by its utter blackness.

###61000940
...Indeed, the Abyss may be unstoppable...

###61000950
Still I have faith, that Princess Dusk 
may be rescued yet...

###61001000
Thou art from a time far, far ahead.

###61001010
There are many things I wish to ask.

###61001020
...But I know that I must not.

###61001030
The perils of our time are overwhelming enough.

###61001100
Hah hah...Was thine eye, glancing hither?

###61001110
Thou needst not hide thy wonder.

###61001120
I am a mushroom, after all.

###61001130
Hee hee hee...

###61001200
Not long ago, I had another visitor.

###61001210
A human like thineself, from a far-away time.

###61001220
Only, he was dreadfully odious...

###61001230
And I am afraid that he is still amongst us.

###61001240
He wore a hat and a long black coat...

###61001300
I will remember thee,
but I will keep thy story to myself.

###61001310
This is the best way,
for thou art come from a time far ahead.

###61001320
No-one will sing thy praises,
but yet thy greatness shall live on.

###61001330
For it shall be my purpose,
to remember all thou hast done for us.

###61005000
Ah!

###61005020
Aaah!

###61005040
Please, no!

###61005050
Stop!

###61005100
Aiieeek!

###61005110
Aiieeegh!

###61005120
Ooh...aah...

###61005130
But, why... Why... Dear Dusk...
